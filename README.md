# Asset-Portfolio-Analysis
This collaborative project aims to analyze the stock portfolio comprised of 3 assets (Berger Paints Nig., United bank of Africa (UBA) AND Total Energies Marketing Nig.) based on the summary statistics of the annualized returns for 3years (December 2020 - December 2023) and to find correlation and covariance matrix for all 3 assets. 
The same procedure is also implemented on the 3 different cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH and USDT using similar summary statistics.
Additionally, same procedure is also on 3 government and corporate bonds namely: Nuveen New York Municipal Bond Fund (NTNYX), 5-year maturity US Treasury Note (FVX), Vanguard Short Term Corate Bond Index Fund (VCSH) and iShares Tips Bond ETF (TIPS).
The specific summary statistics used for these analyses are Skewness, Volatility, and Kurtosis.
The probabiliity of shorting assets in the portfolio was documented in the report. The credit risks involved in the owning each portfolio was also considered.
In conclusion, we analysed an article that documents the FTX collapse event - which ravaged the crypto space in November 2022. While the section of the project is a reported interview session between interviewer, and two interviewees: a Tech oriented personnel (Ms. Parker) and Non-tech personnel (Ms. Ellie), the article aimed to addreess financial regulation to prevent future FTX collapse.
